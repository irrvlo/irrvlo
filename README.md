## Hello!

I'm irrvlo, a beginner programmer that has started way too many projects and is burnt out 99% of the time :P

### Programming

I'm somewhat experienced in JS, I do more backend than frontend, but frontend is really fun
I'm trying to get into other languages, like C#, Java, maybe Lua (for roblox :P)

### Music

I am a musician, I play guitar, piano, (used to play trumpet) and sing. I listen to a variety of genres like Jazz Fusion (listen to Casiopea :P), Rock, Pop, etc.
You can find some of my music [here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5ndtYQXJoyrvAgIpiCbkTw)

other than that, I sometimes upload to youtube or whatever

### Some projects as mentioned above
