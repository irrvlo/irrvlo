## Hello!

I'm irrvlo, a beginner programmer that has started way too many projects and is burnt out 99% of the time :P

### Programming

I'm somewhat experienced in JS, I do more backend than frontend, but frontend is really fun

I'm trying to get into other languages, like C#, Java, maybe Lua (for roblox :P)

other than that, I sometimes do youtube or whatever
